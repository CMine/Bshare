What is BScore?
---------------------------------------
Despite having characteristics of an financially stable individual, many black citizens (and other minority groups) are protrayed negatively when financially scored (e.g. FICO). While there are a plethora of causes that have resulted in this economic disparity, such as the inability to capture non-traditional payments, BScore preposes a simple solution. Utilizing the power of blockchains and digital currency we aim to create an alternative financial scoring system which levels the playing field. Our vision: simply type in a address and recieve a fair score in minutes.


What We Envision for the Project
---------------------------------------
(1) Light Weight && Mobile Friendly: 
	It would be better if no installation was required and the site was fully accessible on mobile devices.

(2) Intuitive Design: 
	Life doesn't need to be any harder than it is and we want the focus to be on quickly getting a fair score.

(3) Versatile with all Digital Currencies: 
	Ideally this service would work with any type of digital currency, for now we will stick with the most popular.


Project Development (What we're doing?)
---------------------------------------
(1) Building the site
	To ensure the site is light weight and mobile friendly we have decided to use Material Design Lite (Â© Google, 2015. Licensed under an Apache-2 license.) as our framework. We appreciate the simplicity and beauty that the framework provides but also feel it will provide the best mobile and desktop experience for all our users. The principles themselves have helped us consider other accessability issues which might have otherwise gone unnoticed.
